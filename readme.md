# Simple URL

> Scalable URL Shortener written in TypeScript / Express with React frontend.

Goal of the project is to design a highly scalable URL shortener that does not have collisions when generating a new url. The API servers sit behind a Load Balancer, as many API Servers can be booted as needed. Load balancing occurs in a round robin format. There are plans to provide analytics on each of the links
